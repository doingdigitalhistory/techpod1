                        <h4>Context</h4>
                        <p>In the decades leading up to the American Civil War there was growing tension between Southern 'slave' states and Northern 'free' states over the question of slavery. One of the largest points of friction on a practical level was the legal status of runaway slaves. Southern slave owners saw these fugitives as their property with legal status similar to livestock and, as such, expected that these runaway slaves be returned into their control. Slaves were often even branded with their owner's mark much the same way that livestock or timber was, and still is, branded. Whenever these poor souls managed to successfully escape into the Northern free states they would often be hidden, sheltered, and supported by Northern citizens who did not see these fugitives as stray property but as wrongfully enslaved human beings. Seeing them as fellow human beings worthy of basic freedom and dignity, these Northerners would openly disregard laws that called for these slaves to be returned to their owners and would also actively disrupt the efforts of slave catchers - effectively acting as bounty hunters - to track down, capture, and return these people to Southern slave owners. Advertisements like this are a testament to this game of cat and mouse that was played for decades between slave and free states. Eventually this precarious standoff slid into open conflict initiated by Southern secession and military action at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. This led to the bloodbath of the American Civil War in which the North, through massive sacrifice and force of arms, ultimately crushed the Confederate States of America. In doing so an entire culture of chattel slavery was consigned to history on this continent and the abolition of such slavery was enshrined in the Constitution of the United States with the ratification of the 13th amendment on December 6, 1865. </p>

                        <h4>Analysis</h4>
                        <p>Preston Worthy
Shows the commodification of enslaved people through repeated buying and selling, stripping them of stability.
The detailed descriptions (scars, missing teeth, gray hair) reflect both the physical toll of slavery and the effort to mark them as identifiable property.
The suspicion that they sought to return home underscores enslaved peoples deep desire for family and community, despite systemic disruption.
The fluctuating reward amounts reveal the transactional nature of human lives under slavery.
