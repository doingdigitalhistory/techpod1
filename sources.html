            <p class="intro-text">This collection presents four primary sources that illuminate Runaway Slave Advertisements in Pre-Civil War America. Through careful analysis, we argue that these advertisements offer insight into the institution of slavery in the United States and serve as a testament to the struggle for freedom.</p>

            <div class="argument-content">
                <p><strong>Slave ads expose the brutality of slavery not only in its economic commodification of human beings but also in its systematic attempt to erase their humanity, criminalize solidarity, and sever family bonds. Yet, paradoxically, these ads also testify to enslaved people’s resilience and resistance, since every notice is evidence of someone’s refusal to remain enslaved.</strong></p>

                        <h4>Context</h4>
                        <p>In the decades leading up to the American Civil War there was growing tension between Southern 'slave' states and Northern 'free' states over the question of slavery. One of the largest points of friction on a practical level was the legal status of runaway slaves. Southern slave owners saw these fugitives as their property with legal status similar to livestock and, as such, expected that these runaway slaves be returned into their control. Slaves were often even branded with their owner's mark much the same way that livestock or timber was, and still is, branded. 
                            Whenever these poor souls managed to successfully escape into the Northern free states they would often be hidden, sheltered, and supported by Northern citizens who did not see these fugitives as stray property but as wrongfully enslaved human beings. Seeing them as fellow human beings worthy of basic freedom and dignity, these Northerners would openly disregard laws that called for these slaves to be returned to their owners and would also actively disrupt the efforts of slave catchers - effectively acting as bounty hunters - to track down, capture, and return these people to Southern slave owners. Advertisements like this are a testament to this game of cat and mouse that was played for decades between slave and free states. Eventually this precarious standoff slid into open conflict initiated by Southern secession and military action at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. This led to the bloodbath of the American Civil War in which the North, through massive sacrifice and force of arms, ultimately crushed the Confederate States of America. In doing so an entire culture of chattel slavery was consigned to history on this continent and the abolition of such slavery was enshrined in the Constitution of the United States with the ratification of the 13th amendment on December 6, 1865. </p>

                        <h4>Analysis</h4>
                        <p>Preston Worthy
Shows the commodification of enslaved people through repeated buying and selling, stripping them of stability.
The detailed descriptions (scars, missing teeth, gray hair) reflect both the physical toll of slavery and the effort to mark them as identifiable property.
The suspicion that they sought to return home underscores enslaved peoples deep desire for family and community, despite systemic disruption.
The fluctuating reward amounts reveal the transactional nature of human lives under slavery.

                        <p>[Robert J. Howard
Reveals the horrifying reality that even children were enslaved and subject to runaway ads.
The racialized description (“bright mulatto”) shows how mixed-race children were still trapped in slavery.
The additional reward for convicting harborers demonstrates how the system punished compassion and solidarity, criminalizing basic human empathy.

                        <p>Gardner Folsome
Highlights how enslaved people sought family ties even across distances, suggesting John may have fled to reunite with his wife.
The ad criminalizes community support (“cautioned from harboring”), showing how laws and social pressure worked to isolate fugitives.
The clothing description humanizes John in one sense, but is used to track him like stolen property.

Shows how enslaved people were treated as fugitives from property, not as human beings.
The physical description emphasizes racialized stereotypes and attempts to mark Henry as dangerous or undesirable.
The tiered reward system reveals the economic logic of slavery: higher value placed on preventing escape beyond local boundaries.
